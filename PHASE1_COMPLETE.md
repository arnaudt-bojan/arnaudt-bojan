### 2. Contract Generation Scripts ✅

- **`scripts/generate-openapi-express.ts`** - Express REST API → OpenAPI
- **`scripts/generate-openapi-nestjs.ts`** - NestJS → OpenAPI (minimal spec)
- **`scripts/generate-graphql-schema.ts`** - GraphQL schema extractor
- **`scripts/contracts.sh`** - CLI tool for all contract operations

### 3. Contract Diff Script ✅

- **`tests/contract-diff.ts`** - CI-ready schema diff checker
  - Compares OpenAPI specs (detects removed endpoints/methods)
  - Compares GraphQL schemas (detects type/query changes)
  - Reports breaking vs non-breaking changes
  - Exits with code 1 on breaking changes (fails CI)

**Validation**:
```bash
./scripts/contracts.sh diff
# ✅ SUCCESS: No breaking changes detected!
```
