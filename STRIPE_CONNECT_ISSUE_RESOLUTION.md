# Stripe Connect Issue - Root Cause & Resolution

## 🔴 THE ISSUE

When clicking "Connect Stripe Account" in Settings → Payment, you're seeing this error:

```
Error: Failed to create Express account
StripeInvalidRequestError: You can only create new accounts if you've signed up for Connect...
```

## ✅ ROOT CAUSE

**Your Stripe account hasn't enabled Stripe Connect.**

Stripe Connect is a separate feature that must be activated before you can create Express accounts for sellers in a marketplace platform like Uppfirst.

## 🛠️ HOW TO FIX (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Enable Stripe Connect

1. **Go to Stripe Connect Settings**:  
   👉 https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview

2. **Click "Get Started"** or **"Enable Connect"** button

3. **Fill out the quick setup form**:
   - **Platform Name**: Uppfirst (or your platform name)
   - **Platform Type**: Marketplace  
   - **Business Model**: Multi-seller marketplace

4. **Accept Terms of Service**

5. **Click "Submit"** or **"Enable Connect"**

✅ **Done!** Stripe Connect is now enabled.

### Step 2: Test the Connection

1. Go back to Uppfirst → **Settings** → **Payment**
2. Click **"Connect Stripe Account"**
3. You'll now be redirected to Stripe onboarding
4. Complete the Stripe Express account setup
5. Return to Uppfirst and you're ready to accept payments!

## 🧪 TESTING STRIPE CONNECT

### Test Mode (Recommended for Development)
1. Use **Test API Keys** from https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
   - `pk_test_...` for VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
   - `sk_test_...` for STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

2. **Test Cards**:
   - Success: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Any future expiry date, any CVC
   - All test transactions are FREE

### Live Mode (Production Only)
1. Use **Live API Keys** from https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
   - `pk_live_...` for VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
   - `sk_live_...` for STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

2. Real money transactions (Stripe fees apply)
3. Requires completed business verification

## 💡 HOW IT WORKS

```
User clicks "Connect Stripe"
    ↓
Backend: POST /api/stripe/create-express-account
    ↓
Stripe checks: Is Connect enabled?
    ├─ ✅ YES → Create Express account → Return account link
    └─ ❌ NO  → Return error with setup instructions
    ↓
Frontend: Show error toast + Open Connect setup page
```

## 🎯 PAYMENT FLOW (Once Connected)

```
1. Buyer purchases from Seller's store
2. Payment goes to Stripe
3. Uppfirst takes 1.5% platform fee
4. 98.5% goes directly to Seller's connected account
5. Seller name appears on buyer's statement (not Uppfirst)
```
