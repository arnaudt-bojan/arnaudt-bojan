## 3. Automated Checks (CI)

### GitHub Actions Enforcement

```yaml
name: Feature Delivery Gate

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  quality-gate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Check tests exist
        run: tsx scripts/auto-coverage-detector.ts
        
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
        
      - name: Check coverage threshold
        run: |
          # Check coverage >80%
          COVERAGE=$(npm run test:coverage | grep "All files" | awk '{print $4}')
          if [ $(echo "$COVERAGE < 80" | bc) -eq 1 ]; then
            echo "Coverage below 80%: $COVERAGE"
            exit 1
          fi
      
      - name: Type check
        run: npm run check
      
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint || true
```

## 4. Feature Flags

### Strategy for Safe Rollouts

```typescript
// server/lib/feature-flags.ts
export const featureFlags = {
  newCheckoutFlow: process.env.FEATURE_NEW_CHECKOUT === 'true',
  aiRecommendations: process.env.FEATURE_AI_RECS === 'true',
  // Add new features here
};

// Usage
if (featureFlags.newCheckoutFlow) {
  return newCheckoutService.process(order);
} else {
  return legacyCheckoutService.process(order);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Deploy code without activating
- Toggle features on/off
- A/B testing
- Gradual rollouts

---

## 5. Deployment Stages

### Progressive Rollout

```
1. Deploy to Staging
   ↓
2. Run smoke tests
   ↓
3. Deploy to 5% of users (canary)
   ↓
4. Monitor metrics for 1 hour
   ↓
5. Deploy to 50% of users
   ↓
6. Monitor metrics for 2 hours
   ↓
7. Deploy to 100%
```

---

## 6. Rollback Criteria

### Auto-Rollback Triggers

- Error rate >1% for 5 minutes
- P95 latency >500ms for 5 minutes
- Critical bug reported
- Failed health checks

### Manual Rollback

```bash
# Revert to previous version
git revert <commit-hash>
git push

# Or use deployment platform rollback
# (if using Replit Deployments, use UI)
```
