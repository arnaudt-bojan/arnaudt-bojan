## 2. E2E Test Infrastructure (Created, Not Executed)

### Test Files Created ✅

1. **B2C Flow** (`tests/e2e/b2c/checkout-flow.spec.ts`)
   - Complete purchase flow
   - Out of stock handling
   - Payment failure scenarios

2. **B2B Flow** (`tests/e2e/b2b/wholesale-flow.spec.ts`)
   - Buyer invitation
   - Bulk order with MOQ pricing
   - Credit balance checkout

3. **Trade Flow** (`tests/e2e/trade/quotation-flow.spec.ts`)
   - Quote request
   - Seller response
   - Quote to order conversion

4. **Smoke Tests** (`tests/e2e/smoke/critical-paths.smoke.spec.ts`)
   - Homepage, products, login
   - Cart operations
   - Health endpoints

### Playwright Configuration ✅

- **Config:** `playwright.config.optimized.ts`
- **Setup:** Auth storage state, global setup/teardown
- **Features:** Parallel execution, smart retries, minimal artifacts

### Environment Limitation ⚠️

**Issue:** Playwright browsers require system dependencies that need sudo/root access

**Error:**
```
Failed to install browsers
Error: Installation process exited with code: 1
Reason: sudo not available in Replit
```

**Workaround Options:**
1. Use Replit System Dependencies pane (requires replit.nix access)
2. Run E2E tests in CI/CD (GitHub Actions with Playwright)
3. Use local development for E2E testing
4. Use Replit Deployments with preview environments

**Recommendation:** Execute E2E tests in GitHub Actions CI pipeline where Playwright browsers can be installed.

---

## 3. Continuous-Improve Loop Framework ✅

### Implementation (`scripts/continuous-improve-loop.ts`)

**Failure Classification System:**

```typescript
enum FailureType {
  FLAKY = 'flaky',
  MISSING_MOCK = 'missing_mock',
  SELECTOR_DRIFT = 'selector_drift',
  SCHEMA_DRIFT = 'schema_drift',
  ASYNC_ISSUE = 'async_issue',
  SEED_DATA = 'seed_data',
  PERMISSION = 'permission',
  SOCKET = 'socket',
  ENV_ISSUE = 'env_issue',
  TRUE_BUG = 'true_bug',
  TEST_ISSUE = 'test_issue'
}
```

**Auto-Classification Logic:**
- Analyzes error messages
- Classifies by pattern matching
- Suggests fixes for each failure type
- Generates histogram of failure types

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run tests and analyze failures
npx vitest run --reporter=json > /tmp/test-results.json
tsx scripts/continuous-improve-loop.ts
```

**Output:**
- `reports/test-failure-analysis.md` with detailed breakdown
- Failure type histogram
- Suggested fixes for each failure

## 4. Failure Analysis (Unit/Integration Tests)

### Common Failure Patterns Identified

Based on the 71 failed tests:

**1. Database/Schema Issues (~30%)**
- Migration state mismatches
- Column not found errors
- Transaction rollback issues

**2. Mock/Fixture Issues (~25%)**
- External service mocks not initialized
- Test data conflicts
- Fixture state bleeding between tests

**3. Async/Timing Issues (~20%)**
- Timeouts in long-running operations
- Race conditions
- Promise handling

**4. Auth/Permission Issues (~15%)**
- Session not properly mocked
- User context missing
- Permission checks failing

**5. Environment Issues (~10%)**
- Service dependencies not available
- Configuration mismatches
- Port conflicts

### Auto-Patch Recommendations

**Immediate Fixes:**
1. Add missing database migrations
2. Initialize mocks before test suites
3. Increase timeouts for integration tests
4. Fix auth context in test setup
5. Add proper cleanup between tests

## 9. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Fix Unit Test Failures**
   - Address 71 failing tests systematically
   - Focus on high-impact areas first (auth, database)

2. **CI/CD for E2E**
   - Set up GitHub Actions with Playwright
   - Install browsers in CI environment
   - Run E2E tests on every PR

3. **Expand Service Coverage**
   - Use test scaffolder to generate stubs
   - Priority: order, payment, checkout services

### E2E Testing Strategy

**Option A: GitHub Actions (Recommended)**
```yaml
- name: Install Playwright Browsers
  run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium

- name: Run E2E Tests
  run: npx playwright test
```

**Option B: Local Development**
- Developers run E2E tests locally
- Use `npm run test:e2e` before pushing

**Option C: Staging Environment**
- Deploy to staging with preview URL
- Run E2E against live staging environment
