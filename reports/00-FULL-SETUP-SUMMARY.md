## ❓ FAQ

### Q: How do I run just the smoke tests?
```bash
npm run test:e2e:smoke
# or
npx playwright test --project=smoke
```

### Q: A test is failing. How do I debug?
```bash
# Run with UI mode
npx playwright test --ui

# Run with headed browser
npx playwright test --headed

# Run with debug mode
npx playwright test --debug checkout-flow
```

### Q: How do I add a test for a new service?
```bash
# Option 1: Auto-generate stub
npm run scaffold:tests -- --generate --limit 1

# Option 2: Manual
# Copy existing test file, rename, update tests
```

### Q: What's the difference between unit and integration tests?
- **Unit:** Tests one function/class in isolation (mock dependencies)
- **Integration:** Tests multiple components together (real dependencies)
- **E2E:** Tests full user flows through UI (real browser)

### Q: How do I skip a flaky test temporarily?
```typescript
test.skip('flaky test', async ({ page }) => {
  // Will not run
});
```

### Q: Can I run tests in parallel locally?
```typescript
Yes! Vitest runs in parallel by default.
For Playwright: it's already configured with fullyParallel: true
```

### Q: How do I mock an external API?
```typescript
// In Playwright
await page.route('**/api/stripe/**', route => {
  route.fulfill({ status: 200, body: JSON.stringify({ ... }) });
});

// In Vitest
vi.mock('@stripe/stripe-js', () => ({ ... }));
```
