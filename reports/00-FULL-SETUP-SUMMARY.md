## ⚠️  Environment Limitations & Solutions

### Limitation 1: Playwright Browser Installation

**Issue:** Playwright browsers need system dependencies requiring sudo

**Current Status:**
- Config: ✅ Complete
- Tests written: ✅ Complete  
- Browser install: ❌ Blocked in Replit

**Solutions:**
1. **GitHub Actions** (Recommended):
   ```yaml
   - run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
   - run: npx playwright test
   ```

2. **Local Development:**
   - Developers run E2E locally before pushing

3. **Replit Deployments:**
   - Use preview deployments for E2E testing

### Limitation 2: Some Unit Tests Failing

**Issue:** 71 unit/integration tests failing (14.3%)

**Root Causes (Classified):**
- Database/Schema: ~30%
- Mocks/Fixtures: ~25%
- Async/Timing: ~20%
- Auth/Permission: ~15%
- Environment: ~10%

**Continuous-Improve Loop:**
- ✅ Classification system implemented
- ✅ Auto-suggestions for fixes
- ✅ Failure histogram generated

**Action Items:**
1. Fix database migration issues
2. Initialize mocks properly
3. Increase integration test timeouts
4. Fix auth context in test setup

## 🚀 How to Use This System

### For Developers

**Creating Tests:**
```bash
# Detect files without tests
tsx scripts/auto-coverage-detector.ts

# Generate stubs
tsx scripts/generate-test-stubs.ts --limit 10

# Implement tests in generated files
```

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# All unit/integration
npm test

# Specific category
npx vitest run tests/socket
npx vitest run tests/services

# Watch mode
npx vitest watch
```

**E2E Tests (CI/Local):**
```bash
# Install browsers (CI/Local only)
npx playwright install chromium --with-deps

# Run smoke tests
npx playwright test --project=smoke

# Run all E2E
npx playwright test
```

### For CI/CD

**GitHub Actions Integration:**
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/test-enforcement.yml`
- Auto-detects missing tests
- Runs full test suite
- Comments on PRs with results

**Build Deployment:**
```bash
# Production build with Prisma
node scripts/build-wrapper.js
npm start
```
