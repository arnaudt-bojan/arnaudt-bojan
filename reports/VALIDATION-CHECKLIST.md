- **Status:** Infrastructure ready, just needs CI environment

**2. Unit Test Failures** (Priority: High)
- **Issue:** 71 tests failing (14.3%)
- **Blocker:** Various (DB, mocks, async, auth, env)
- **Proposed Patch:** Use continuous-improve loop to classify and fix
- **Status:** Classification complete, fixes ready to implement

**3. Coverage Target** (Priority: Low)
- **Issue:** 25% coverage vs 80% target
- **Blocker:** 220+ files without tests
- **Proposed Patch:** Use auto-coverage detector + scaffolder
- **Status:** Tools ready, needs time investment
