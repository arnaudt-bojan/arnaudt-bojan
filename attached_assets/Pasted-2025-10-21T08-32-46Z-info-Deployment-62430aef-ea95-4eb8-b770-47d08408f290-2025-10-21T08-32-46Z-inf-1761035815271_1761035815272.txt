npm warn deprecated lodash.omit@4.5.0: This package is deprecated. Use destructuring assignment syntax instead.

npm warn deprecated lodash.get@4.4.2: This package is deprecated. Use the optional chaining (?.) operator instead.

npm warn deprecated lodash.isequal@4.5.0: This package is deprecated. Use require('node:util').isDeepStrictEqual instead.

npm warn deprecated json-schema-ref-parser@9.0.9: Please switch to @apidevtools/json-schema-ref-parser

npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.

npm warn deprecated node-domexception@1.0.0: Use your platform's native DOMException instead

npm warn deprecated subscriptions-transport-ws@0.11.0: The `subscriptions-transport-ws` package is no longer maintained. We recommend you use `graphql-ws` instead. For help migrating Apollo software to `graphql-ws`, see https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/subscriptions/#switching-from-subscriptions-transport-ws    For general help using `graphql-ws`, see https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/README.md

npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported

npm warn deprecated @apollo/server-gateway-interface@1.1.1: @apollo/server-gateway-interface v1 is part of Apollo Server v4, which is deprecated and will transition to end-of-life on January 26, 2026. As long as you are already using a non-EOL version of Node.js, upgrading to v2 should take only a few minutes. See https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/previous-versions for details.

npm warn deprecated @apollo/server-plugin-landing-page-graphql-playground@4.0.1: The use of GraphQL Playground in Apollo Server was supported in previous versions, but this is no longer the case as of December 31, 2022. This package exists for v4 migration purposes only. We do not intend to resolve security issues or other bugs with this package if they arise, so please migrate away from this to [Apollo Server's default Explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/plugin/landing-pages) as soon as possible.

npm warn deprecated @irys/sdk@0.0.2: Arweave support is deprecated - We recommend migrating to the Irys datachain: https://migrate-to.irys.xyz/

npm warn deprecated @apollo/server@4.12.2: Apollo Server v4 is deprecated and will transition to end-of-life on January 26, 2026. As long as you are already using a non-EOL version of Node.js, upgrading to v5 should take only a few minutes. See https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/previous-versions for details.
