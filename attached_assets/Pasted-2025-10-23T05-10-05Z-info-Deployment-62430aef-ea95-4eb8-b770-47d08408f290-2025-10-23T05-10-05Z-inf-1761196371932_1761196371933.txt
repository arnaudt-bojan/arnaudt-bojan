✅ Backend build complete

📦 Building frontend...

Usage Error: The nearest package directory (/home/runner/workspace/frontend) doesn't seem to be part of the project declared in /home/runner/workspace.

- If /home/runner/workspace isn't intended to be a project, remove any yarn.lock and/or package.json file there.
- If /home/runner/workspace is intended to be a project, it might be that you forgot to list frontend in its workspace configuration.
- Finally, if /home/runner/workspace is fine and you intend frontend to be treated as a completely separate project (not even a workspace), create an empty yarn.lock file in it.
