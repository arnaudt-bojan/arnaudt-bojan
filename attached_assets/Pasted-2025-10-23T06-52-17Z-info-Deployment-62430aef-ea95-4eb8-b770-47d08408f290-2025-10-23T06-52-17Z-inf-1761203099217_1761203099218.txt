   Building with Next.js (this may take several minutes)...

 ‚ö† Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of /home/runner/workspace/yarn.lock as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more information.
 Detected additional lockfiles:

a port configuration was specified but the required port was never opened
2025-10-23T07:03:48Z error: The deployment failed because the application failed to open a port in time. This can happen because the application takes to long to open a server, or doesn't open one at all on the expected port. Note that this doesn't mean that the application is crashing, only that it's not opening a port in time. The application must serve traffic on the first port specified as 'localPort' in the port configuration specified in the .replit file. Make sure that the application opens a port quickly and that there are no operations taking too long on startup. Check the logs for more information.
