Yes—two last blockers, then you’re done.

1) Frontend build: TS tries to import Codegen

Error: Cannot find module '@graphql-codegen/cli' (from frontend build scanning ../codegen.ts).

Fix (pick ONE):

A. Exclude dev file from frontend TS
	•	frontend/tsconfig.json → add:

{
  "exclude": ["../codegen.ts"]
}

OR B. Keep it, add dev dep to frontend

yarn workspace frontend add -D @graphql-codegen/cli

(Do A if codegen.ts lives at repo root and isn’t needed at runtime.)

Also keep the minor TS fixes you already hit:

onEditorChange={(newContent: string) => setContent(newContent)}
label={(entry: {name: string}) => entry.name}

2) Port not opened / crash loop

Your Deploy expects the app to open $PORT (Replit sets it). Backend must listen on it, and your start script must not cd ../frontend.

Backend (Nest) main.ts — ensure:

const port = Number(process.env.PORT) || 4000;
await app.listen(port);

scripts/start-production.sh — single server (recommended):

#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
node backend/dist/main.js

(If you insist on running Next separately, use concurrently and be sure one of them listens on $PORT. Easiest is backend only, and serve built static files from backend later.)

3) Prisma engine mismatch (you already surfaced it)

Keep this in backend/prisma/schema.prisma:

generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = ["native","debian-openssl-1.1.x","debian-openssl-3.0.x"]
}

And regenerate during build:

yarn workspace backend prisma generate --schema backend/prisma/schema.prisma

4) Workspace hygiene
	•	Root package.json:

{ "private": true, "workspaces": ["backend","frontend"] }

	•	Delete frontend/yarn.lock from the repo.
	•	.yarnrc.yml at root:

nodeLinker: node-modules

5) Build + Deploy sequence (clean)

# from repo root
rm -f frontend/yarn.lock
printf 'nodeLinker: node-modules\n' > .yarnrc.yml

# If you chose option B earlier, install it; if option A, skip this line
yarn workspace frontend add -D @graphql-codegen/cli

rm -rf node_modules .yarn/cache .yarn/install-state.gz backend/node_modules/.prisma
yarn install

# prisma + builds
yarn workspace backend prisma generate --schema backend/prisma/schema.prisma
yarn workspace backend build
yarn workspace frontend build   # will succeed if A or B done

# Deploy/Promote

That addresses:
	•	Codegen import during Next build ✅
	•	Single process opening $PORT fast ✅
	•	Prisma engine runtime mismatch ✅
	•	Lockfile/workspace conflicts ✅

If you later want the frontend served too: either serve the built Next static from the backend, or run both with concurrently (ensure backend listens on $PORT and Next on another internal port).
