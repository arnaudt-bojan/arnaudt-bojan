# Database Hardening Changes

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Added Indexes on Foreign Keys
- carts: seller_id, buyer_id
- orders: user_id, seller_id
- order_items: order_id, product_id
- quotations: seller_id, buyer_id
- wholesale_orders: seller_id, buyer_id
- wholesale_order_items: order_id, product_id

### 2. Added CASCADE Rules
- order_items → orders (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- trade_quotation_items → trade_quotations (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- wholesale_order_items → wholesale_orders (ON DELETE CASCADE)

### 3. Fixed Audit Timestamps
- orders: created_at changed from String to DateTime
- orders: added updated_at field
- products: verified created_at/updated_at exist
- trade_quotations: verified timestamps exist

## Performance Impact
- Queries on foreign keys: 10-100x faster at scale
- Prevents orphan records
- Enables proper audit trails
