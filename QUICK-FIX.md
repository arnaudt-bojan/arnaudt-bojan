# Quick Fix for Replit Deployment

## 🐛 **The Problem**
Deployment fails with: `Cannot find module 'tsx'`

## ✅ **The Solution** (Already Done!)

The `start.sh` script has been updated to use `npx tsx` which works correctly.

**Verify `.replit` file line 14 says:**

```toml
run = ["sh", "start.sh"]
```

**Or alternatively:**

```toml
run = ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

Both work! Just redeploy and it should succeed. ✅
