# Upfirst - E-Commerce Platform

## Overview
Upfirst is a D2C (Direct-to-Consumer) e-commerce platform for creators and brands to sell various product types: in-stock, pre-order, made-to-order, and wholesale. Each seller operates an isolated storefront via subdomain (`username.upfirst.io` in production) with no cross-seller discovery. The platform offers product browsing, a shopping cart, authenticated checkout, and a comprehensive seller dashboard. Key features include a B2B wholesale system, AI-optimized social media advertising integration, and robust multi-seller payment processing via Stripe Connect. It aims to be a seamless, modern, and scalable D2C solution with strong security, multi-currency support, and a comprehensive tax system.

## User Preferences
- **Communication Style**: I prefer clear, concise explanations with a focus on actionable steps.
- **Coding Style**: Favor modern JavaScript/TypeScript practices, functional components in React, and maintainable code.
- **Workflow Preferences**: I prefer an iterative development approach, focusing on core features first and then enhancing them.
- **Interaction Preferences**: Ask for confirmation before implementing significant architectural changes or refactoring large portions of the codebase.
- **Working Preferences**: Ensure all UI implementations adhere to the `design_guidelines.md` and prioritize mobile-first responsive design. Ensure consistent spacing and typography. Do not make changes to the `replit.nix` file.

## System Architecture
Upfirst uses a modern web stack with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI for the frontend, utilizing TanStack Query and React Context for state management, and Wouter for routing. Forms are handled by React Hook Form with Zod validation. The backend is an Express.js, Node.js application, with PostgreSQL (Neon) and Drizzle ORM for data persistence.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Design System**: Supports dark/light mode, Inter font family, consistent spacing and typography, and mobile-first responsive design.
- **Navigation**: Dashboard-centric design with consistent navigation; desktop uses a header, mobile uses a burger menu.
- **Product Display**: Multi-image support with interactive carousels and color-coded product types.
- **Dashboard Design**: Seller dashboard includes revenue analytics and order management; buyer dashboard offers order tracking.
- **Storefront Branding**: Displays store logo > Instagram username > seller name as fallback.

**System Design Choices & Feature Specifications:**
- **Product Management**: Supports diverse product types (in-stock, pre-order, made-to-order, wholesale) with multi-image uploads, bulk CSV import, and a simplified size-first variant system. Includes a flexible shipping system with package presets, international carrier templates, and zone-based matrices.
- **Shopping & Checkout**: Features a slide-over and persistent cart, guest checkout, and automatic server-side shipping cost calculation, enforcing a single-seller constraint per cart.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Email-based authentication with a dual-token system (6-digit codes and magic links). Implements a capability-based authorization service with resource-scoped permissions for multiple user types (seller, buyer, collaborator).
- **Notification System**: Comprehensive, refactored email notifications using Resend with dark mode compatibility and templated messages.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrated with Stripe Connect for multi-seller payments, supporting various methods and borderless seller onboarding. Includes PCI-DSS compliant saved addresses and payment methods.
- **Subscription System**: Monthly/annual subscription model for sellers with a free trial, managed via Stripe.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: IP-based currency detection with user-selectable currency, real-time exchange rates, and backend-driven seller-specific currency display.
- **Wholesale B2B System**: Invitation-only access for managing wholesale products and orders.
- **Social Ads System**: Multi-platform social advertising (Meta, TikTok, X) with AI optimization.
- **Item-Level Order Tracking**: Comprehensive per-item fulfillment system with independent status, tracking, and automated buyer notifications.
- **Document Generation System**: Professional PDF invoice and packing slip generation (B2C and wholesale templates).
- **Subdomain Architecture**: Environment-aware routing for seller storefronts (`username.upfirst.io` in production, `/s/username` in dev) with smart navigation between domains.
- **Tax System (B2C)**: Automated sales tax calculation via Stripe Tax for B2C transactions.
- **Pricing Service & Fail-Safe System**: Centralized pricing calculations for consistency and security.
- **Team Management**: Role-based access (owner, admin, editor, viewer) with invitation-based team expansion and granular permissions.
- **Platform Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive dashboard for Upfirst platform owners.
- **Storefront Customization**: Sellers can add About Story, contact info, and social media links.
- **Inventory Management System**: Transaction-based stock reservation system with atomic operations, PostgreSQL row-level locking, and variant-level race protection
  - **Core**: Service-oriented design (`InventoryService`) with atomic operations using SELECT FOR UPDATE
  - **Variant Protection**: Row-level locking protects entire variants JSONB array; reservations filter by exact variantId (e.g., "large-red"); available stock = variant.stock - SUM(active reservations for that variantId)
  - **Critical Requirement**: When reserving stock for products with variants, variantId MUST be supplied to ensure correct variant is locked
  - **Three-Layer Release Defense**: Primary (checkoutSessionId), Fallback (order items matching), Cleanup Job (5min intervals)
  - **Payment Flow**: Reserve â†’ (Success = Commit + Decrement) OR (Failure = Release) OR (Expiration = Auto-Release)
- **Order Management System**: Comprehensive order lifecycle management with status tracking, refunds, shipping updates, and balance payments
  - **Core Methods**: `updateOrderStatus` (status changes + document generation), `processRefund` (full/partial with Stripe), `updateTracking` (shipping updates + notifications), `requestBalancePayment` (pre-order balance collection)
  - **Storage Abstraction**: All order operations use IStorage interface only - no direct Drizzle table imports in services
  - **Refund Handling**: Supports full order and item-level partial refunds with automatic Stripe processing and order item tracking updates
  - **Balance Payments**: Creates separate Stripe payment intents for pre-order balance collection with automatic currency handling
