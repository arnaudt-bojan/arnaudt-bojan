# Upfirst - E-Commerce Platform

## Overview
Upfirst is a D2C e-commerce platform designed to empower creators and brands with individual, subdomain-based storefronts. It supports diverse product types (in-stock, pre-order, made-to-order, wholesale) and integrates essential e-commerce functionalities such as product management, shopping cart, authenticated checkout, a comprehensive seller dashboard, and AI-optimized social media advertising. The platform includes B2B wholesale capabilities, multi-seller payment processing, multi-currency support, and an advanced tax system. Its purpose is to deliver a scalable, secure, and modern direct-to-consumer solution with significant market potential.

## User Preferences
- **Communication Style**: I prefer clear, concise explanations with a focus on actionable steps.
- **Coding Style**: Favor modern JavaScript/TypeScript practices, functional components in React, and maintainable code.
- **Workflow Preferences**: I prefer an iterative development approach, focusing on core features first and then enhancing them.
- **Interaction Preferences**: Ask for confirmation before implementing significant architectural changes or refactoring large portions of the codebase.
- **Working Preferences**: Ensure all UI implementations adhere to the `design_guidelines.md` and prioritize mobile-first responsive design. Ensure consistent spacing and typography. Do not make changes to the `replit.nix` file. **MANDATORY: ALL state-changing operations MUST emit Socket.IO events to affected users (see SOCKETIO_USAGE_RULES.md)**.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
The platform comprises three distinct, parallel platforms: B2C Retail, B2B Wholesale, and Professional Quotations. All business logic, calculations, and data transformations are strictly implemented server-side. The system is designed mobile-first and is Docker-ready, utilizing a monorepo structure.

### Technology Stack
-   **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (React 18) with Material UI v7 and Apollo Client - **Migration to Next.js 16 COMPLETED (51/51 pages)**
-   **Backend**: NestJS with GraphQL API (primary) and minimal REST endpoints for health checks.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) with Prisma ORM.
-   **Real-time**: Socket.IO for comprehensive real-time updates across all modules.

### UI/UX Decisions
-   Supports dark/light modes, uses Inter font, and maintains consistent spacing and typography.
-   Emphasizes mobile-first responsive design.
-   Features dashboard-centric navigation.
-   Allows customizable seller branding for storefronts.

-   **Next Steps**: Phase 3 E2E testing, final verification, deploy new frontend

### October 2025 - Deployment Fixes
-   **Production Build Fix**: Fixed TypeScript compilation failing during deployment
    -   Created `typecheck:build` script in backend using `tsconfig.build.json`
    -   Production builds now exclude test files (apps/backend/test/)
    -   Prevents build failures from missing dev dependencies (nock, vitest)
    -   Updated `prebuild` script to use `typecheck:build` instead of `typecheck`
-   **Backend Start Path Fix**: Fixed backend crash ("Cannot find module dist/apps/backend/src/main")
    -   NestJS builds to `apps/backend/dist/main.js` not `dist/apps/backend/src/main`
    -   Updated backend `start:prod` script: `node dist/apps/backend/src/main` → `node dist/main`
    -   Backend now starts correctly in production
-   **NPX Binary Resolution Fix**: Fixed deployment crash with wrong package versions
    -   Issue: `npx` bypassed local workspace dependencies causing MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors
    -   Issue: `npx next` downloaded Next.js 16.0.0 instead of using local 14.2.33
    -   Issue: `npx concurrently` in root spawned subprocesses without workspace PATH
    -   Solution: Removed `npx` from ALL scripts (root + workspaces) to use local binaries
    -   Changed root: `npx concurrently` → `concurrently`
    -   Changed frontend: `npx next build/start` → `next build/start`
    -   Changed backend: `npx nest build` → `nest build`, `npx prisma` → `prisma`
    -   Local binaries now resolved correctly from workspace node_modules/.bin
    -   **CRITICAL**: npm scripts automatically add node_modules/.bin to PATH, making `npx` unnecessary and problematic in monorepos
-   **Replit Deployment node_modules Persistence Issue**: Fixed "concurrently: not found" at runtime
    -   Issue: Replit deployments do NOT persist `node_modules` from build phase to runtime phase
    -   Build phase runs `npm install` successfully, but runtime has no `node_modules`
    -   Solution: Install dependencies at runtime in `.replit` configuration
    -   Required `.replit` change:
      ```toml
      [deployment]
      build = ["sh", "-c", "npm ci --include=dev && npm run build"]
      run = ["sh", "-c", "npm ci --include=dev && npm start"]
      ```
    -   `--include=dev` required because build tools (TypeScript, NestJS CLI) are in devDependencies
    -   Trade-off: Adds 30-60s to cold start time, but guarantees dependency availability
    -   This is a Replit platform limitation for Autoscale deployments

### October 2025 - Yarn Berry Migration & Apollo Integration Fix (v4.10.3)
-   **Package Manager Migration**: Successfully migrated from npm to Yarn Berry v4.10.3
    -   Fixed root cause: Package version conflicts AND incorrect package placement (Apollo in root vs frontend)
    -   Key insight: `.yarn/install-state.gz` should be committed when `packageManager` field is fixed
-   **Apollo Integration Fix**: Resolved peer dependency errors and Next.js 14 compatibility
    -   **Version Downgrade**: Apollo packages 0.13.2 require Next.js 15+, downgraded to versions supporting Next.js 14
        - `@apollo/client`: 4.0.7 → **3.10.4** (v3 API compatibility)
        - `@apollo/client-integration-nextjs`: 0.13.2 → **0.12.0** (supports Next.js 14)
        - `@apollo/client-react-streaming`: 0.13.2 → **0.11.11** (supports Next.js 14)
        - `@apollo/experimental-nextjs-app-support`: 0.13.2 → **0.11.11** (supports Next.js 14)
    -   **Package Relocation**: Moved Apollo packages from root to `apps/frontend/package.json` (proper peer dependency resolution)
    -   **Missing Peer Dependencies Added**:
        - Frontend: `@mui/system@7.3.3`, `rxjs@7.8.1`
        - Backend: `rxjs@7.8.1`
        - Root: `graphql@16.11.0`
    -   **Import Errors Fixed**: Updated `apps/frontend/lib/apollo-client.tsx` for Apollo v3 API (removed v4-specific exports)
    -   **Cleanup**: Removed unused packages (`@solana/spl-token`, `@solana/web3.js`) saving ~50MB
-   **Critical Fixes Applied**:
    1. **Removed `.yarn/install-state.gz` from .gitignore** - State file must be committed when Yarn version is pinned
    2. **Fixed backend package.json scripts** - Changed `npm run` → `yarn` in all scripts (prebuild, prebuild:fast, build:fast, check)
    3. **Fixed frontend package.json scripts** - Changed `npm run` → `yarn` in all scripts (prebuild, check)
    4. **Generated Prisma Client** - Root cause of TypeScript errors was missing Prisma Client generation
-   **Configuration**:
    -   `.yarnrc.yml`: `nodeLinker: node-modules`, `nmMode: hardlinks-local`, `enableGlobalCache: false`
    -   `package.json`: `"packageManager": "yarn@4.10.3"` (via Corepack)
    -   Generated `yarn.lock` (739KB) with all dependencies resolved
-   **Results**:
    -   Zero critical peer dependency errors (YN0002)
    -   Backend running on port 4000 with 0 errors
    -   Frontend compiled 13,408 modules successfully
    -   Dev mode fully operational
-   **Benefits**:
    -   Faster installation with hardlinks and local cache
    -   Deterministic builds with fixed Yarn version
    -   Better monorepo support with workspace protocol
    -   Apollo Client fully functional with Next.js 14
