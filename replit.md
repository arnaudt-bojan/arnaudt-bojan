## Data Models

### Product
- id (UUID)
- name
- description
- price (decimal)
- image (URL)
- category
- productType (in-stock | pre-order | made-to-order | wholesale)
- stock (integer, optional)

### Order
- id (UUID)
- customerName
- customerEmail
- customerAddress
- items (JSON string of cart items)
- total (decimal)
- status (pending | processing | shipped | delivered | cancelled)
- createdAt (timestamp)

### Cart Item
- Product + quantity

## Next Steps (Backend Implementation)
1. Implement storage interface for Products, Orders, Cart
2. Create API endpoints:
   - GET /api/products - List all products
   - GET /api/products/:id - Get product by ID
   - POST /api/orders - Create new order
   - GET /api/orders - List all orders (for seller dashboard)
3. Seed initial product data
4. Test complete user flows

## Design Guidelines
- Follow design_guidelines.md for all UI implementations
- Use Inter font for all text
- Maintain consistent spacing (small: p-2/4, medium: p-6/8, large: p-12/16)
- Product type badges use specific colors:
  - In-stock: green
  - Pre-order: blue
  - Made-to-order: purple
  - Wholesale: orange
- Dark mode support throughout
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Roles
- **Customer**: Default role for all new users. Can browse products, place orders, view order history
- **Seller**: Elevated role with access to seller dashboard, product management, and order fulfillment

### How to Make a User a Seller
1. Log in to Replit
2. Open the Database pane
3. Run this SQL query (replace with actual email):
   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET role='seller' WHERE email='user@example.com';
   ```
4. The user will gain seller access on their next login or page refresh

### Protected API Endpoints
- `POST /api/orders` - Requires authentication (links order to user automatically)
- `GET /api/orders/my` - Requires authentication (customer's own orders)
- `GET /api/orders` - Requires seller role (all orders for dashboard)
- `POST /api/products` - Requires seller role
- `PUT /api/products/:id` - Requires seller role
- `DELETE /api/products/:id` - Requires seller role
- `PATCH /api/orders/:id/status` - Requires seller role

### Auth Implementation Details
- **Provider**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **Session**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions (express-session + connect-pg-simple)
- **Middleware**: `isAuthenticated` and `isSeller` protect routes
- **Anonymous Access**: `/api/auth/user` returns 200 with null for unauthenticated users
- **Role Preservation**: Existing user roles are preserved on re-login
