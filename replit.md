# Upfirst - E-Commerce Platform

## Overview
Upfirst is an e-commerce platform designed for creators and brands to sell various product types: in-stock, pre-order (with deposit), made-to-order, and wholesale. It aims to provide a seamless buying and selling experience with a unified user model. Key capabilities include product browsing, a shopping cart, authenticated checkout, a comprehensive seller dashboard for product and order management, and a B2B wholesale system with invitation-only access. The platform also integrates advanced social media advertising features with AI optimization, robust payment processing, and NFT minting for buyers.

## User Preferences
- **Communication Style**: I prefer clear, concise explanations with a focus on actionable steps.
- **Coding Style**: Favor modern JavaScript/TypeScript practices, functional components in React, and maintainable code.
- **Workflow Preferences**: I prefer an iterative development approach, focusing on core features first and then enhancing them.
- **Interaction Preferences**: Ask for confirmation before implementing significant architectural changes or refactoring large portions of the codebase.
- **Working Preferences**: Ensure all UI implementations adhere to the `design_guidelines.md` and prioritize mobile-first responsive design. Ensure consistent spacing and typography. Do not make changes to the `replit.nix` file.

## System Architecture
Upfirst is built with a modern web stack. The frontend uses **React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI** for a responsive user experience, with **TanStack Query** and **React Context** for state management, and **Wouter** for routing. Forms are handled by **React Hook Form** with **Zod** validation. The backend is an **Express.js, Node.js** application, using **PostgreSQL (Neon)** with **Drizzle ORM** for persistent data storage.

**Navigation Architecture:**
- **Dashboard-Centric Design**: Seller Dashboard is the main hub with quick access to all features via action chips
- **Consistent Navigation**: All seller pages (Settings, Products, Orders, etc.) include a "Back to Dashboard" breadcrumb in the same location
- **Desktop Navigation**: Clean header with Dashboard and Settings buttons visible on desktop (no burger menu clutter)
- **Mobile-First**: Burger menu appears on mobile devices for easy access to all features
- **Storefront**: Buyer-facing pages remain clean while maintaining subtle access to seller dashboard

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Design System**: Supports dark/light mode, uses Inter font family, consistent spacing and typography, and mobile-first responsive design.
- **Product Display**: Features multi-image support with interactive carousels and thumbnail galleries. Product types are color-coded (In-Stock: Green, Pre-Order: Blue, Made-to-Order: Purple, Wholesale: Orange).
- **Dashboard Design**: Seller dashboard includes revenue analytics and order management. Buyer dashboard offers order tracking and NFT minting access.

**Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications:**
- **Product Management**: Supports diverse product types (in-stock, pre-order, made-to-order, wholesale) with multi-image uploads and bulk CSV upload functionality.
- **Shopping & Checkout**: Features a slide-over cart, quantity adjustment, persistent cart, and guest checkout. Shipping costs are fetched from seller settings and automatically added to the total. All orders require customerEmail and create/use buyer accounts. **Cart enforces single-seller constraint** - products from different sellers cannot be mixed in one cart to ensure proper payment routing (Stripe Connect) and data isolation.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: 
  - Email-based authentication (verification code and magic link) for sellers only - creates admin role accounts
  - All emails normalized to lowercase and trimmed for consistency
  - Buyers created automatically via guest checkout (no email auth)
  - Buyer accounts have null passwords (security measure - cannot login)
  - 4-role system: admin, editor, viewer (sellers) and buyer
  - Seller emails blocked from guest checkout to prevent role confusion
  - **Order Authorization**: Comprehensive multi-tenant security - sellers can only view/modify orders containing their products; buyers can only view their own orders; platform owner/admin can access all orders. Cart validation enforces single-seller orders for proper data isolation and payment routing.
- **Notification System**: 
  - Comprehensive email notification system using Resend
  - All emails sent from Upfirst (platform branding), seller emails use Reply-To
  - Development mode: verification codes logged to console when domain unverified
  - Phase 1 notifications implemented: seller welcome (triggered on signup)
  - Phase 1 templates ready: Stripe onboarding reminders, payment failures, inventory alerts, payout failures (require webhook integration)
  - 30+ notification types planned across 3 phases (see docs/notification-system-design.md)
- **Payment Processing**: Integrated with **Stripe Connect** for multi-seller payments, supporting Apple Pay, Google Pay, and credit cards. Supports balance payments for pre-orders. Each order contains products from a single seller only - payment routes directly to that seller's Stripe Connect account.
- **Subscription System**: 
  - Sellers pay a monthly ($9.99) or annual ($99) fee with a 30-day free trial
  - New sellers default to inactive store status (storeActive: 0)
  - Activating store triggers subscription flow via SubscriptionPricingDialog
  - Store toggle appears in both Dashboard and Products pages with consistent behavior
  - Toggle disabled until user data loads to prevent cache corruption
  - Optimistic updates maintain proper user object shape for reliable subscription gating
  - Payment methods securely stored using Stripe Customer objects
  - Development mode creates Stripe prices dynamically (avoids hardcoded test price IDs)
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Automatic IP-based currency detection with a user-selectable currency switcher and real-time exchange rate conversion.
- **NFT Minting**: Buyers can mint NFTs on the Solana devnet for fully paid orders, integrated with Phantom wallet.
- **Wholesale B2B System**: Invitation-only system for managing wholesale products with specific pricing and order requirements.
- **Social Ads System**: Comprehensive multi-platform social advertising (Meta, TikTok, X) with AI optimization, creative controls, and budget management.
- **Instagram Integration**: Sellers can connect Instagram to use their username as their store URL.
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions using `express-session` and `connect-pg-simple`.
- **Store Visibility Control**: Sellers can toggle store status (active/inactive). Inactive stores show a "Store Unavailable" page to buyers with seller contact info, while sellers retain full access to manage their inactive stores.
- **Newsletter System**: Comprehensive email marketing system with subscriber management, rich text editor (React Quill), email groups/segments, live preview (desktop/mobile), and analytics dashboard. Integrated with Resend batch API for bulk sending with open/click/bounce tracking. Development mode logs newsletters to console for testing with unverified domains. Includes tracking pixels, unsubscribe links, and deduplicated event analytics. Production-ready pending domain verification.
- **Image Editing System**: Built-in image editor for logo and banner customization using react-easy-crop. Features crop, zoom (1-3x), rotation (0-360Â°), flip (horizontal/vertical), and filters (brightness, contrast, saturation, blur, grayscale, sepia). Implements official react-easy-crop getCroppedImg pattern for proper rotation/flip handling. Settings page includes loading state for proper tab rendering and CORS headers on /objects/ route enable canvas-based image processing.
- **Item-Level Order Tracking**: Comprehensive per-item fulfillment system with independent status, tracking, and shipping for each product in an order. Features:
  - **Order Items Table**: Each cart item creates an order_item record with individual status (pending/processing/shipped/delivered/cancelled), tracking number, tracking carrier, tracking URL, and shipping timestamps
  - **Enhanced Tracking Fields**: Full support for trackingNumber, trackingCarrier (e.g., "UPS", "FedEx", "DHL"), and trackingUrl (full tracking link) - all fields properly persist to database
  - **Fulfillment Status**: Orders automatically compute fulfillmentStatus ('unfulfilled'|'partially_fulfilled'|'fulfilled') based on item statuses
  - **Partial Shipments**: Sellers can ship items independently - order marked 'partially_fulfilled' when some items shipped, 'fulfilled' when all complete
  - **Item Tracking Notifications**: Automated emails to buyers when tracking is added to items, showing item details, image, tracking number, carrier, and tracking link
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy items JSON field and order-level tracking fields maintained; new orders create both JSON and order_items records
  - **API Architecture**: GET /api/orders/:orderId/items, PATCH /api/order-items/:id/tracking (accepts trackingNumber, trackingCarrier, trackingUrl, notifyCustomer), PATCH /api/order-items/:id/status with seller authorization
  - **Test Mode**: Stripe test mode bypasses Connect requirements for easier testing of order/tracking features
- **Flexible Shipping System**: Three-tier shipping configuration for maximum seller flexibility:
  - **Shipping Matrices**: Sellers create zone-based shipping rates (continent/country/city level) with custom names and estimated delivery times. Comprehensive multi-tenant security ensures sellers can only access/modify their own matrices.
  - **Product-Level Shipping Choice**: Each product can use: (1) Flat rate, (2) Saved matrix, (3) Shippo real-time rates, or (4) Free shipping
  - **Shippo Integration**: Real-time carrier rate calculation using package dimensions (weight/length/width/height) or carrier templates (USPS, FedEx, UPS boxes)
  - **Database Schema**: shipping_matrices table stores zone definitions; shipping_zones table contains rates per zone; products table includes shipping configuration fields (shippingType, flatShippingRate, shippingMatrixId, shippo dimensions/template)
  - **Settings UI**: Dedicated "Shipping Matrix" tab in Settings for creating and managing shipping zones with easy table interface
  - **Product Form Integration**: Shipping Configuration section in product create/edit forms with conditional UI based on shipping type - displays flat rate input, matrix selector, Shippo dimensions/template fields, or free shipping message
