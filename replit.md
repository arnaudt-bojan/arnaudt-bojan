## User Preferences
- **Communication Style**: I prefer clear, concise explanations with a focus on actionable steps.
- **Coding Style**: Favor modern JavaScript/TypeScript practices, functional components in React, and maintainable code.
- **Workflow Preferences**: I prefer an iterative development approach, focusing on core features first and then enhancing them.
- **Interaction Preferences**: Ask for confirmation before implementing significant architectural changes or refactoring large portions of the codebase.
- **Working Preferences**: Ensure all UI implementations adhere to the `design_guidelines.md` and prioritize mobile-first responsive design. Ensure consistent spacing and typography. Do not make changes to the `replit.nix` file.

## System Architecture
Upfirst utilizes a modern web stack: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI for the frontend, with an Express.js Node.js backend, PostgreSQL (Neon), and Drizzle ORM.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
The design system supports dark/light mode, uses the Inter font, and emphasizes consistent spacing, typography, and a mobile-first responsive approach. Navigation is dashboard-centric, and storefronts are customizable with seller branding. Product displays feature multi-image support and interactive elements.

**Technical Implementations:**
-   **Backend:** Employs a service layer pattern with dependency injection for business logic abstraction (e.g., `ProductService`, `StripeConnectService`, `WholesaleService`).
-   **Business Mode Toggle:** Sellers can switch between B2C (Retail), B2B (Wholesale), and Trade (Professional) modes within the dashboard, altering context and available routes.
-   **Product Management:** Supports diverse product types, simplified size-first variants, multi-image uploads, and best-in-class bulk CSV import with job tracking and validation.
-   **Shipping:** Centralized `ShippingService` integrates various methods including Free Shipping, Flat Rate, Matrix Shipping, and real-time Shippo API rates.
-   **Shopping & Checkout:** Features slide-over cart, guest checkout, server-side shipping cost calculation, single-seller per cart constraint, and optimized cart performance.
-   **Authentication & Authorization:** Email-based authentication with a dual-token system and capability-based authorization for seller, buyer, and collaborator roles.
-   **Notification System:** Comprehensive email and in-app notifications with shared templates, powered by Resend.
-   **Payment Processing:** Integrated with Stripe Connect for multi-seller payments, supporting various methods and PCI-DSS compliance.
-   **Subscription System:** Monthly/annual seller subscriptions managed via Stripe, including a 30-day trial.
-   **Multi-Currency Support:** IP-based detection with user-selectable currency and real-time exchange rates.
-   **Wholesale B2B System:** Invitation-based access, variant-level MOQ enforcement, deposit/balance payment splits, freight collect/buyer pickup shipping, and comprehensive order lifecycle management with automated notifications.
-   **Trade Quotation System:** Professional B2B quotation platform with an excel-like builder, server-side pricing validation, deposit/balance payment flows, secure token-based buyer access, and comprehensive status tracking.
-   **Social Ads System:** Multi-platform (Meta, TikTok, X) social advertising with AI optimization.
-   **Item-Level Order Tracking:** Per-item fulfillment system with independent status and tracking.
-   **Document Generation:** Professional PDF invoice and packing slip generation.
-   **Subdomain Architecture:** Environment-aware routing for seller storefronts.
-   **Tax System (B2C):** Automated sales tax calculation via Stripe Tax API.
-   **Pricing Service:** Centralized pricing calculations for consistency and security.
-   **Team Management:** Simplified single-collaborator model with email-based invitations.
-   **Inventory Management:** Production-ready transaction-based stock reservation with atomic operations, PostgreSQL row-level locking, and automatic stock synchronization.
-   **Cart Reservation System:** Implements a "soft hold" pattern with reservations created at checkout, a 30-minute expiry, and automatic release/commit mechanisms.
-   **Order Management System:** Comprehensive order lifecycle management with status tracking, refunds, and balance payments.
-   **Real-Time Order Updates:** WebSocket-based live order synchronization with automatic frontend cache invalidation.
-   **Delivery Date Display:** Pre-order and made-to-order products display delivery dates on checkout and order confirmation pages. Pre-order items show customer-selected dates while made-to-order items calculate delivery dates from order date plus lead time. Delivery dates are persisted in order snapshots (order.items JSON and order_items table) to ensure accuracy even if products are modified or deleted.
-   **Bulk Product Upload System:** Shopify-class bulk upload with comprehensive CSV import, job tracking, validation, and rollback. Features include: URL-safe delimiters (@@ and ;;) for color variants preserving HTTPS URLs, real-time validation with row-level error reporting, batch processing with progress tracking, persistent job history, one-click rollback to undo imports, and Architecture 3 compliance with server-side calculations. Utilizes `BulkUploadService` with papaparse CSV parsing and Zod validation.
-   **AI-Powered Field Mapping:** Gemini AI integration for intelligent CSV column mapping directly to database schema. Users can upload CSVs in any format, and the AI automatically maps custom headers to database fields (e.g., name, price, stock, variants) with confidence scores. Features include: database schema-based mapping (not CSV template), high-confidence auto-mapping (>80%), medium-confidence review flags (50-80%), manual mapping for low confidence (<50%), visual confidence indicators, comprehensive data normalization (images, variants, stock), Variant SKU support for both size-only and color variants, robust parsing of JSON/arrays/objects from AI, strict validation (non-negative integer stock, URL extraction from nested objects, color variant flattening), and seamless transformation of any CSV format to database schema. All bulk uploads restricted to in-stock products only. Enables universal CSV import compatibility without requiring specific column names or format.
-   **Newsletter System (Klaviyo-level):** âœ… PRODUCTION-READY - Enterprise-grade email marketing platform refactored to Architecture 3 with complete service layer separation. Core services: `CampaignService` (orchestration, HTML normalization, multi-source recipient merging, sendToAll support), `SubscriberService` (CRUD, bulk operations, unsubscribe), `TemplateService` (personalization, variable substitution), `AnalyticsService` (event tracking, idempotent webhooks), `SegmentationService` (rule evaluation, date validation), `ComplianceService` (GDPR, CAN-SPAM). Features: database-persistent job queue with atomic claiming and retry logic, multi-ESP support via abstraction layer, rate limiting, recipient deduplication across direct/segment/group sources, scheduled campaigns with timezone support, segmentIds persistence for targeted campaigns, and comprehensive analytics. All business logic server-side following Architecture 3 patterns. Complete Zod validation on 11 API routes with user-friendly error messages. Modern campaign builder UI (898 lines) with step-by-step wizard, segment creation/preview, and real-time analytics dashboard.
