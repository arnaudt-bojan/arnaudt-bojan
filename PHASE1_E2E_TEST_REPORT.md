## Conclusion

**‚úÖ PHASE 1 DEPLOYMENT APPROVED** (with staging verification)

The critical Phase 1 fixes for checkout crashes have been successfully validated:
- sellerId is no longer null in cart operations
- Add to cart functionality works without crashes
- Product-to-cart data flow is working correctly

While the full checkout flow cannot be tested without proper Stripe configuration, the specific bugs that were causing crashes in Phase 1 have been fixed and validated.

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy to staging environment with full Stripe configuration
2. Execute full E2E checkout test including payment confirmation
3. Monitor production for any edge cases
4. Proceed with Phase 2 enhancements once Phase 1 is stable
