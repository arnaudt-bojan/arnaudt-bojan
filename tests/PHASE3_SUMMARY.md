# Phase 3: Payments, Email & Catalog Testing - Summary

## Overview

Phase 3 implements comprehensive testing for payments (Stripe/PayPal), email systems (Resend), and catalog import/pricing logic across all 3 business models (B2C, B2B, Trade).

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. Payment Mocks & Tests

#### Stripe Mock (`tests/mocks/stripe-mock.ts`)
- HTTP mocking using `nock` for Stripe API endpoints
- Fixtures for customers, payment intents, charges, and refunds
- Supports all major Stripe operations needed for testing

**Key Features:**
- Mock payment intent creation with different currencies
- Mock refund creation
- Mock payment confirmation and cancellation
- Clean utilities to reset mocks between tests

#### Stripe Integration Tests (`tests/payments/stripe.spec.ts`)
- Tests for `StripePaymentProvider` class
- Currency handling (zero-decimal, two-decimal, three-decimal currencies)
- Payment intent creation and confirmation
- Refund processing
- Amount conversion between major/minor units

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Payment intent creation with USD
- ✅ Zero-decimal currency handling (JPY)
- ✅ Three-decimal currency handling (KWD)
- ✅ Refund creation
- ✅ Currency conversion utilities

#### PayPal Mock (`tests/mocks/paypal-mock.ts`)
- HTTP mocking for PayPal API
- Fixtures for orders and captures
- Support for PayPal checkout flow

### 2. Order State Machine Tests (`tests/payments/order-state-machine.spec.ts`)

Tests the order lifecycle state transitions:

```
pending → paid → fulfilled → delivered
        ↓
   payment_failed
        ↓
    canceled/refunded
```

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Happy path transitions (pending → paid → fulfilled → delivered)
- ✅ Payment failure handling
- ✅ Refund status transitions
- ✅ Cancellation from pending state
- ✅ Order timestamp tracking

### 3. Payment Ledger Tests (`tests/payments/ledger.spec.ts`)

Tests payment tracking and double-charge prevention:

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Payment intent creation tracking
- ✅ Idempotency key enforcement (prevents duplicate payments)
- ✅ Refund tracking in database
- ✅ Partial refund tracking

**Key Business Rules Tested:**
- Idempotency keys prevent duplicate payment intents
- All refunds are tracked in the `refunds` table
- Partial refunds can be issued until full amount is refunded

### 4. Tax Calculations Tests (`tests/payments/tax-calculations.spec.ts`)

Comprehensive tax calculation testing with precision:

**Coverage:**
- ✅ US sales tax calculation (8.75%)
- ✅ VAT-inclusive pricing (EU 20%)
- ✅ VAT extraction with rounding
- ✅ Currency conversion rounding
- ✅ Multi-item order totals (no rounding accumulation)
- ✅ Complex tax scenarios
- ✅ Zero tax rate handling
- ✅ High tax rate handling (25%)

**Precision:**
All calculations use proper rounding: `Math.round(value * 100) / 100` to prevent floating-point errors.

### 5. Email System Tests

#### Resend Mock (`tests/mocks/resend-mock.ts`)
- Vi mock functions for Resend email provider
- Email tracking in memory
- Batch email support
- Utility to query sent emails

#### Email Template Tests (`tests/email/templates.spec.ts`)
Tests for email template rendering:

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Basic email layout generation
- ✅ Upfirst platform header
- ✅ Upfirst platform footer
- ✅ Product thumbnails with variants
- ✅ Product thumbnails without variants
- ✅ CTA button generation
- ✅ Missing optional fields handling
- ✅ Dark mode safety styles

#### Email Webhook Tests (`tests/email/webhooks.spec.ts`)
Tests email suppression lists and audit logging:

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Email bounce handling
- ✅ Email complaint handling
- ✅ Email suppression checking
- ✅ Multiple suppressions for same email
- ✅ Email audit logging (successful sends)
- ✅ Email audit logging (failed sends)

**Key Business Rules:**
- Bounced emails are added to suppression list
- Complained emails are added to suppression list
- All email sends are audited in `email_audit` table

### 6. Catalog Import Tests (`tests/catalog/import-mappers.spec.ts`)

Tests for platform import mappers:

#### Shopify Mapper
- ✅ Basic product mapping
- ✅ Multiple variant handling

#### Etsy Mapper
- ✅ Listing to product mapping
- ✅ Multiple image handling

#### Joor Mapper (B2B)
- ✅ Wholesale product mapping
- ✅ MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity) mapping

#### Generic CSV Mapper
- ✅ Different CSV header format handling

### 7. Pricing Logic Tests (`tests/catalog/pricing.spec.ts`)

Comprehensive pricing and discount tests:

#### Tiered Pricing
- ✅ Volume discount application
- ✅ Edge cases at tier boundaries

#### Discount Precedence
- ✅ Best discount selection (no stacking)
- ✅ Percentage vs fixed discount comparison

#### Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ)
- ✅ MOQ enforcement
- ✅ Wholesale total calculation
- ✅ MOQ boundary validation

#### Complex Scenarios
- ✅ Tiered pricing + discount combination
- ✅ Quantity breaks with tax calculation

## Testing Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Test Organization
- Tests organized by domain: `payments/`, `email/`, `catalog/`
- Mock files in dedicated `mocks/` directory
- Consistent naming: `*.spec.ts` for test files, `*-mock.ts` for mocks

### 2. Test Tags
All tests tagged for easy filtering:
- `@payments` - Payment-related tests
- `@email` - Email-related tests
- `@catalog` - Catalog-related tests
- `@integration` - Integration tests (require database)

### 3. Database Testing
- Use `testDb.reset()` before each test
- Use `createFixtures()` helper for test data
- All integration tests properly isolated

### 4. Mocking Strategy
- **HTTP APIs**: Use `nock` for Stripe/PayPal (external APIs)
- **Functions**: Use `vi.fn()` for Resend (JavaScript SDK)
- **Database**: Use real database with fixtures (not mocked)

### 5. Precision in Financial Calculations
All monetary calculations use:
```typescript
Math.round(value * 100) / 100
```
This prevents floating-point precision errors.

## Running the Tests

### Run All Phase 3 Tests
```bash
npm run test tests/payments/ tests/email/ tests/catalog/
```

### Run by Domain
```bash
# Payment tests only
npm run test tests/payments/

# Email tests only
npm run test tests/email/

# Catalog tests only
npm run test tests/catalog/
```

### Run by Tag
```bash
# All payment tests
npm run test -- --grep "@payments"

# Integration tests only
npm run test -- --grep "@integration"
```

### Run Single Test File
```bash
npm run test tests/payments/stripe.spec.ts
```

## Test Coverage

| Domain | Files | Tests | Coverage |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| Payments | 4 | ~25 | Stripe provider, order states, ledger, tax |
| Email | 2 | ~12 | Templates, webhooks, suppressions |
| Catalog | 2 | ~15 | Import mappers, pricing logic |
| **Total** | **8** | **~52** | **Comprehensive** |

## Key Integration Points

   - Tests validate refund logic
   - Tests validate amount conversions

2. **Email Templates** (`server/utils/email-templates.ts`)
   - Tests validate template rendering
   - Tests validate dark mode safety
   - Tests validate all template components

3. **Database Schema**

   - Tests validate `refunds` table
   - Tests validate `email_suppressions` table
   - Tests validate `email_audit` table
   - Tests validate `orders` table state transitions

## Business Rules Validated

2. ✅ Orders transition through valid states only
3. ✅ Refunds are tracked in ledger
4. ✅ Partial refunds are supported
5. ✅ All currencies handled correctly (0, 2, 3 decimal places)

### Email

4. ✅ MOQ is enforced for wholesale products

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Snapshot Testing** for email templates (using Vitest snapshots)
2. **Performance Tests** for pricing calculations
3. **Load Tests** for payment processing
4. **End-to-End Tests** using Playwright for full checkout flow
5. **PayPal Integration Tests** (currently only mocked)

### Test Data Management
Consider implementing:
- Factory pattern for test data creation
- Shared fixtures library
- Database seeders for specific test scenarios

## Conclusion

Phase 3 successfully implements comprehensive testing for the three critical domains:
1. **Payments**: Stripe/PayPal integration, order states, ledger tracking
2. **Email**: Template rendering, webhook handling, suppression lists
3. **Catalog**: Import mappers, pricing logic, discounts

All tests follow best practices:
- Proper isolation
- Clear naming
- Comprehensive coverage
- Precise calculations
- Integration with existing codebase

The test suite provides confidence that payment processing, email delivery, and catalog management work correctly across all 3 business models (B2C, B2B, Trade).
