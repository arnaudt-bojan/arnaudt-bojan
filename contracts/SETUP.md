# Contract Testing Setup Guide

## Installation Complete âœ…

Phase 1 of contract testing and auth testing has been successfully implemented!

## What's Been Created

### 1. Contract Files

```
contracts/
â”œâ”€â”€ openapi-express.json       # Express REST API contract (7 endpoints)
â”œâ”€â”€ openapi-nestjs.json         # NestJS API contract (minimal spec)
â”œâ”€â”€ graphql-schema.graphql      # GraphQL schema (3012 lines)
â”œâ”€â”€ baseline/                   # Baseline contracts for diff checking
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ openapi-express.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ openapi-nestjs.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ graphql-schema.graphql
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                   # Full documentation
â””â”€â”€ SETUP.md                    # This file
```

### 2. Test Suites

- **`server/__tests__/auth-matrix.spec.ts`** - 30+ test cases covering:
  - B2C platform auth (products, cart, orders, checkout)
  - B2B wholesale platform auth
  - Trade quotations platform auth
  - Cross-platform auth isolation

- **`server/__tests__/auth-flows.spec.ts`** - 25+ test cases covering:
  - Registration flows (buyer & seller)
  - Login flows
  - Logout flows
  - Session management
  - Password reset
  - Magic link authentication
  - Auth token security
  - Role-based redirects

### 3. Helper Scripts

- **`tests/setup/auth-helpers.ts`** - Auth utilities:
  - `createBuyerSession()`
  - `createSellerSession()`
  - `createAdminSession()`
  - `loginAs()`
  - `logout()`
  - Session management helpers

- **`scripts/contracts.sh`** - Contract management CLI:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/contracts.sh generate:all      # Generate all contracts
  ./scripts/contracts.sh update-baseline   # Update baselines
  ./scripts/contracts.sh diff              # Check for breaking changes
  ./scripts/contracts.sh test:auth         # Run auth tests
  ```

### 4. Contract Diff Script

- **`tests/contract-diff.ts`** - CI-ready schema diff checker:
  - Compares OpenAPI specs (openapi-diff)
  - Compares GraphQL schemas (graphql-schema-diff)
  - Detects breaking vs non-breaking changes
  - Fails CI on breaking changes

## Quick Start

### 1. Generate Contracts

```bash
./scripts/contracts.sh generate:all
```

This creates:
- `contracts/openapi-express.json` - Express REST endpoints
- `contracts/openapi-nestjs.json` - NestJS endpoints
- `contracts/graphql-schema.graphql` - GraphQL schema

### 2. Run Auth Tests

```bash
# Run all auth tests
vitest run server/__tests__/auth-matrix.spec.ts server/__tests__/auth-flows.spec.ts

# Or use the helper script
./scripts/contracts.sh test:auth

# Run specific test suites
vitest run server/__tests__/auth-matrix.spec.ts
vitest run server/__tests__/auth-flows.spec.ts
```

### 3. Check for Breaking Changes

```bash
./scripts/contracts.sh diff
```

Expected output:
```
ðŸ“Š Checking OpenAPI specs...
ðŸ“Š Checking GraphQL schema...

================================================================================
ðŸ“‹ CONTRACT DIFF SUMMARY
================================================================================

ðŸ“„ openapi-express.json

ðŸ“„ openapi-nestjs.json

ðŸ“„ graphql-schema.graphql

================================================================================

âœ… SUCCESS: No breaking changes detected!
All API contracts are backward compatible.
```

## NPM Scripts Alternative

Since package.json modification is restricted, use the shell script:

```bash
# Instead of: npm run generate:contracts
./scripts/contracts.sh generate:all

# Instead of: npm run test:contracts
./scripts/contracts.sh diff

# Instead of: npm run contracts:update-baseline
./scripts/contracts.sh update-baseline

# Instead of: npm run test:auth
./scripts/contracts.sh test:auth
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Contract Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  contract-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      
      - name: Generate contracts
        run: ./scripts/contracts.sh generate:all
      
      - name: Run contract diff
        run: ./scripts/contracts.sh diff
      
      - name: Run auth tests
        run: ./scripts/contracts.sh test:auth
```

## Development Workflow

### Making API Changes

1. **Make your changes** to the API (add/modify/remove endpoints)

2. **Regenerate contracts**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/contracts.sh generate:all
   ```

3. **Check for breaking changes**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/contracts.sh diff
   ```

4. **Review the diff output**:
   - ðŸ”´ Breaking changes - Requires major version bump
   - ðŸŸ¡ Non-breaking changes - OK to merge

5. **If breaking changes are intentional**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/contracts.sh update-baseline
   git add contracts/baseline/
   git commit -m "Update API baselines (BREAKING CHANGE)"
   ```

6. **Run auth tests**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/contracts.sh test:auth
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### "No baseline found" Error

First time setup - create baselines:
```bash
./scripts/contracts.sh update-baseline
```

### Auth Tests Failing

Check that the Express app is properly configured:
```bash
# Ensure database is running
npm run db:push

# Check that test users exist
# Tests use email auth with code '111111'
```

### Contract Generation Fails

Ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
npm install
```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Add @nestjs/swagger decorators** to NestJS controllers for full OpenAPI spec
2. **Expand test coverage** for edge cases and error scenarios
3. **Add CSRF protection tests** (currently using session-based auth)
4. **Implement rate limiting tests** for auth endpoints
5. **Add contract validation** in E2E tests (Playwright)

### Integration Opportunities

1. **Swagger UI**: Serve OpenAPI specs at `/api-docs`
2. **GraphQL Playground**: Auto-configured at `/graphql` (NestJS)
3. **Pre-commit hooks**: Auto-run contract diff before commits
4. **API Documentation**: Generate docs from OpenAPI specs

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check `contracts/README.md` for detailed documentation
2. Review test files for usage examples
3. Run `./scripts/contracts.sh` (no args) for command reference
