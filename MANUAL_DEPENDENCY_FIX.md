# 🔧 Manual Dependency Fix Required

## Why This Matters

You asked an **excellent question**: "Why is `--include=dev` needed for prod deployment?"

**Answer:** It shouldn't be! The problem is that many **build-time** packages are incorrectly in `dependencies` instead of `devDependencies`.

---

## 📋 Required Changes

### **1. Root `package.json` Changes**

**Open `package.json` and move these from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`:**

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    // Move these from dependencies:
    "nodemon": "^3.1.10",
    "glob": "^11.0.3",
    
    // Add these back (I removed them):
    "@graphql-codegen/cli": "^6.0.1",
    "@graphql-codegen/client-preset": "^5.1.0",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript": "^5.0.2",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript-operations": "^5.0.2",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript-react-apollo": "^4.3.3",
    "@playwright/test": "^1.56.1",
    "eslint": "^8.57.1",
    "eslint-config-next": "^15.5.6"
  }
}
```

**Keep in `dependencies` (needed at runtime):**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@apollo/client-integration-nextjs": "^0.14.0",
    "@apollo/client-react-streaming": "^0.14.0",
    "@whatwg-node/fetch": "^0.10.11",
    "@whatwg-node/node-fetch": "^0.8.1",
    "concurrently": "^9.2.1",
    "sass": "^1.93.2",
    "tsconfig-paths": "^4.2.0"
  }
}
```

### **2. Backend `apps/backend/package.json` Changes**

**Move these from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`:**

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@graphql-codegen/cli": "^6.0.0",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript": "^5.0.2",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript-operations": "^5.0.2",
    "@graphql-codegen/typescript-resolvers": "^5.1.0",
    "prisma": "^6.17.1"
  }
}
```

**Keep `@prisma/client` in `dependencies`** (runtime needed).

---

## 🚀 After Making These Changes

### **Step 1: Reinstall Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### **Step 2: Update `.replit` Deployment Config**

**Edit `.replit` and change:**

```toml
[deployment]
build = "npm ci && npm run build && npm prune --omit=dev"
run = "npm start"
deploymentTarget = "cloudrun"
```

**How this works:**
1. **Build**: Install all deps (including dev for TypeScript compilation)
2. **Build**: Compile everything  
3. **Build**: Remove devDependencies with `npm prune --omit=dev`
4. **Runtime**: Just `npm start` (no install needed)

---

## ✅ Expected Results

### **After Cleanup:**

| What | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Build-time install | 90s | 90s (same) |
| Build | 90s | 90s (same) |
| Runtime install | **60s** | **0s** ✅ |
| Runtime startup | 10s | 10s (same) |
| **Total Cold Start** | **160s (2.7min)** | **10s** ✅ |

### **If node_modules don't persist (fallback):**

Update `.replit` to:
```toml
[deployment]
build = "npm ci && npm run build"
run = "npm ci --omit=dev && npm start"
deploymentTarget = "cloudrun"
```

**Performance:**
- Runtime install: ~20-30s (only production deps)
- Much faster than `--include=dev` (which installs 200+ packages)

---

## 🎯 Why This Is Better

**Before (with `--include=dev`):**
- Installs 400+ packages at runtime
- Includes TypeScript, ESLint, Playwright, etc.
- Slow cold starts (60s+)

**After (with `--omit=dev`):**
- Installs only ~150 production packages
- Just runtime dependencies
- Fast cold starts (20-30s or even 0s if snapshot works)

---

## 📝 Summary

1. **Move build-time deps to devDependencies** (manual edit)
2. **Run `npm install`** to update lock file
3. **Update `.replit`** to use `npm prune --omit=dev` or `--omit=dev`
4. **Redeploy** and enjoy faster startups!
